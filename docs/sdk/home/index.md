## Data Layer Concepts 

The relations between all major Data Layer concepts of the SDK are 
the following: a [Project](#project-concept) consists of multiple [Documents](#document-concept). Each one of the Documents consists of 
the [Pages](#page-concept) and belongs to a certain [Category](#category-concept). Text in a Document can be marked by 
[Annotations](#annotation-concept), which can be multi-line, and where each continuous piece of text contained into an 
Annotation is a [Span](#span-concept). Each Annotation is located within a certain [Bbox](#bbox-concept) and is defined by a 
[Label](#label-concept) that is a part of one of the [Label Sets](#label-set-concept). An [Annotation Set](#annotation-set-concept) is a list of Annotations
that share a Label Set. 

For more detailed information on each concept, follow the link on the concept's name which leads to the automatically 
generated documentation.

.. _project-concept:

### Project
[Project](sourcecode.html#project) is essentially a dataset that contains Documents 
belonging to different Categories or not having any Category assigned. To initialize it, call `Project(id_=YOUR_PROJECT_ID)`. 

The Project can also be accessed via the Smartview, with URL typically looking like 
https://YOUR_HOST/admin/server/document/?project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID.

If you have made some local changes to the Project and want to return to the initial version available at the server, or 
if you want to fetch the updates from the server, use the argument `update=True`.

Here are the some of properties and methods of the Project you might need when working with the SDK:
- `project.documents` – training Documents within the Project;
- `project.test_documents` – test Documents within the Project;
- `project.get_category_by_id(YOUR_CATEGORY_ID).documents()` – Documents filtered by a Category of your choice; 
- `project.get_document_by_id(YOUR_DOCUMENT_ID)` – access a particular Document from the Project if you know its ID.

.. _document-concept:

### Document
[Document](sourcecode.html#document) is one of the files that constitute a Project. It 
consists of Pages and can belong to a certain Category. 

A Document can be accessed by `project.get_document_by_id(YOUR_DOCUMENT_ID)` when its ID is known to you; otherwise, it 
is possible to iterate through the output of `project.documents` (or `test_documents`/`_documents`) to see which 
Documents are available and what IDs they have.

The Documents can also be accessed via the Smartview, with URL typically looking like 
https://YOUR_HOST/projects/PROJECT_ID/docs/DOCUMENT_ID/bbox-annotations/.

Here are some of the properties and methods of the Document you might need when working with the SDK:
- `document.id_` – get an ID of the Document;
- `document.status` – get the status of the Document in the pipeline. The status can be one of the following:
    - Queuing for OCR: 0
    - Queuing for extraction: 1
    - Done: 2
    - Could not be processed: 111
    - OCR in progress: 10
    - Extraction in progress: 20
    - Queuing for categorization: 3
    - Categorization in progress: 30
    - Queuing for splitting: 4
    - Splitting in progress: 40
    - Waiting for splitting confirmation: 41
- `document.dataset_status` – get the dataset status of the Document. The dataset status can be one of the following:
    - None: 0
    - Preparation: 1
    - Training: 2
    - Test: 3
    - Excluded: 4
- `document.text` – get a full text of the Document;
- `document.pages()` – a list of Pages in the Document;
- `document.update()` – download a newer version of the Document from the Server in case you have made some changes in 
the Smartview;
- `document.category()` – get a Category the Document belongs to;
- `document.get_images()` – download PNG images of the Pages in the Document; can be used if you wish to use the visual 
data for training your own models, for example;

.. _category-concept:

### Category
[Category](sourcecode.html#category) is a group of Documents united by common feature or type, i.e. invoice or receipt.

To see all Categories in the Project, you can use `project.categories`. 
To find a Category the Document belongs to, you can use `document.category`.
To get `documents` or `test_documents` under the Category, use `category.documents()` or `category.test_documents()` respectively.

You can also observe all Categories available in the Project via the Smartview: they are listed on the Project's page in the menu on the right.

.. _page-concept:

### Page
[Page](sourcecode.html#page) is a constituent part of the Document. Here are some of the properties and methods of the Page you might need when working with the SDK:
- `page.text` – get text of the Page;
- `page.spans()` – get a list of Spans on the Page;
- `page.number` – get Page's number, starting from 1.

.. _category-annotation-concept:

### Category Annotation
[Category Annotation](sourcecode.html#category-annotation) defines a Category of a Page or a Document. There can be 
more than one Category Annotation per Document and per Page; Category Annotations typically come with different
confidence levels.

To get a Category Annotation of a particular Category for the Page, use `Page.get_category_annotation(category)`. 

To get a maximum-confidence Category Annotation for a Page, use `Page.maximum_confidence_category_annotation`.

To see a maximum-confidence Category Annotation for a Document, use `Document.maximum_confidence_category_annotation`.

.. _span-concept:

### Span
[Span](sourcecode.html#span) is a part of the Document's text without the line breaks. Each Span has `start_offset` and `end_offset` denoting its starting and finishing characters in `document.text`. 

To access Span's text, you can call `span.offset_string`. We are going to use it later when collecting the Spans from the Documents.

.. _annotation-concept:

### Annotation 
[Annotation](sourcecode.html#annotation) is a combination of Spans that has a certain Label (i.e. Issue_Date, Auszahlungsbetrag) 
assigned to it. They typically denote a certain type of entity that is found in the text. Annotations can be predicted 
by AI or be human-added.

Annotations always have to belong to an Annotation Set with a Label Set compatible with the Annotation's Label.

Like Spans, Annotations also have `start_offset` and `end_offset` denoting the starting and the ending characters. To 
access the text under the Annotation, call `annotation.offset_string`.

To see the Annotation in the Smartview, you can call `annotation.get_link()` and open the returned URL. 

Annotation can be created in two ways: using Spans and using Bboxes. 

To create an Annotation using Spans, generate all Spans you want to include into the Annotation using `Span` class and 
supply a list of Spans into `spans` argument of `Annotation` class. 

To create an Annotation using Bboxes, generate all Bboxes you want to include into the Annotation using `Bbox` class. 
**Note**: make sure that all Bboxes you create actually contain OCR-recognized text inside them; otherwise, an Annotation 
will not be created and an error will be raised. After creating the Bboxes, supply a list of them into `bboxes` keyword
argument of `Annotation` class.

.. _annotation-set-concept:

### Annotation Set
[Annotation Set](sourcecode.html#annotation-set) is a group of Annotations united by Labels belonging to the same Label Set. 
To retrieve all that Annotation Sets of a Document call `document.annotation_sets()`. To see Annotations in the set, 
call `annotation_set.annotations()`.

Every Document has one unique default Annotation Set, which can be retrieved with `document.default_annotation_set`. This 
Annotation Set's Label Set is the Document's Category default Label Set and has the same name and ID as the Category. It
can be used to store all Annotations that don't need to be organized into a separate Annotation Set. 

To check what Annotation Labels can be added to an Annotation Set, you can check with `annotation_set.label_set.labels`.

Documents also have a unique Annotation Set for NO LABEL Annotations, which can be retrieved with `document.no_label_annotation_set`.


.. _label-concept:

### Label
[Label](sourcecode.html#label) defines what the Annotation is about (i.e. Issue_Date, 
Auszahlungsbetrag). Labels are grouped into Label Sets. To see Annotations with a current Label, 
call `label.annotations()` .

.. _label-set-concept:

### Label Set
[Label Set](sourcecode.html#label-set) is a group of related Labels. A Label Set can belong to different Categories and 
be used to create one or more [Annotation Sets](#annotation-set-concept), depending on the Label Set.

Every Category has a default Label Set, which can be retrieved with `category.default_label_set`. This Label Set is used 
to create the default Annotation Set for each Document in the Category.

Label Sets have an attribute, `label_set.has_multiple_annotation_sets`, which determines whether more than one Annotation Set
can be created per Document. If `has_multiple_annotation_sets` is `False`, then only a single Annotation Set with the 
Label Set can be created per Document.

.. _bbox-concept:

### Bbox
[Bbox](sourcecode.html#bbox) is used to represent an area of a Page, defined by the coordinates of the bottom left corner
and the top right corner of the bounding box. Check out our [coordinate system explainer](#coordinates-system) for more
details.

You can access all character Bboxes of the Document by using `document.bboxes`. A Bbox can also be associated with a single Span, or with all Spans within an Annotation. To obtain the Bbox associate with a single Span, call `span.bbox()`. To obtain the Bbox wrapping all Spans in an Annotation, call `annotation.bbox()`. This should not be
confused with `Annotation.selection_bbox`, which is an attribute storing the Bbox a user has selected in the Smartview when creating the Annotation.

The following image shows a bounding box with red border, which is retrieved with `Annotation.selection_bbox` , and a bounding box highlighted in green, which is retrieved with `Annotation.bbox()`:

## AI Concepts

Document processing pipeline of Konfuzio consists of several steps that require usage of different AIs. In this section,
we will explain what are these AIs and what concepts they utilize.

### Categorization

Each new Document gets assigned a Category when uploaded to Konfuzio. If you use a Categorization AI to automatically 
assign a Category to a Document (such as the [NameBasedCategorizationAI](#name-based-categorization-ai), each Page will 
be assigned a Category Annotation with predicted confidence information, and the following properties will be 
accessible. You can also find these documented under [API Reference - Document](sourcecode.html#document), 
[API Reference - Page](sourcecode.html#page) and 
[API Reference - Category Annotation](sourcecode.html#category-annotation).

#### Categorization AI Overview Diagram

In the first diagram, we show the class hierarchy of the available Categorization Models within the SDK. Note that the 
Multimodal Model simply consists of a Multi Layer Perceptron to concatenate the feature outputs of a Text Model and an 
Image Model, such that the predictions from both Models can be unified in a unique Category prediction.

In the second diagram, we show how these models are contained within a Model-based Categorization AI. The 
[Categorization AI](https://dev.konfuzio.com/sdk/sourcecode.html#categorization-ai) class provides the high level 
interface to categorize Documents, as exemplified in the code examples above. It uses a Page Categorization Model 
to categorize each Page. The Page Categorization Model is a container for Categorization Models: it wraps the feature 
output layers of each contained Model with a Dropout Layer and a Fully Connected Layer.

### File Splitting

Documents can often come not as separate entities, but rather as a stream of Pages. This leads to a more complex navigation and information 
retrieval. Document splitting tackles this by disentangling these intertwined files into separate Documents. Konfuzio 
SDK introduces you to tools and models that automate this process, streamlining your work with multi-Document PDFs.

You can train your own File Splitting AI on the data from any Project of your choice ([data preparation tutorial here](https://dev.konfuzio.com/sdk/tutorials/data-preparation/index.html)). 
Note that Pages in all the Documents used for training and testing have to be ordered correctly – that is to say, not 
mixed up in order. The ground-truth first Page of each Document should go first in the file, ground-truth second Page 
goes second and so on. This is needed because the Splitting AI operates on the idea that the splitting points in a 
stream of Pages are the starting Pages of each Sub-Document in the stream.

For the purpose of processing documents consisting of multiple files, the SDK offers several tools that facilitate splitting them into sub-documents:

- A [Context Aware File Splitting Model](https://dev.konfuzio.com/sdk/sourcecode.html#context-aware-file-splitting-model) Utilizes a straightforward logic based on scanning documents within a category and identifying strings exclusive to the first pages of each document. An instance of the Context Aware File Splitting Model can be employed to establish an initial file splitting pipeline, which can later be substituted with more intricate and advanced solutions as needed.

- A [Textual File Splitting Model](https://dev.konfuzio.com/sdk/sourcecode.html#textual-file-splitting-model) The Textual File Splitting Model is a key component of the SDK, leveraging state-of-the-art *Transformers* architecture to efficiently split multi-document files into shorter documents while maintaining high accuracy and minimizing latency. By default, the model uses the popular *DistilBERT* architecture which is a distilled version of *BERT*, that offers a compelling blend of accuracy and computational efficiency. By compressing the original *BERT* model, *DistilBERT* reduces the number of parameters by *40%* while keeping *97%* same performance. However, the model used in Textual File Splitting can be customized through a `model_name` class attribute, allowing users to specify their preferred pre-trained *Transformers* model during instantiation.

- A [Multimodal File Splitting Model](https://dev.konfuzio.com/sdk/sourcecode.html#multimodal-file-splitting-model) This model incorporates both textual and visual data from documents, making it suitable for various document types and average-sized datasets. However, it may operate at a slower speed compared to the Textual File Splitting Model and is more prune to overfitting.

For developing a custom File Splitting approach, we propose an abstract class `AbstractFileSplittingModel`.

### Information Extraction

[Information Extraction](https://dev.konfuzio.com/sdk/tutorials/information_extraction/index.html) is a process of 
obtaining information from the Document's unstructured text and labelling it with Labels like Name, Date, Recipient, or any other custom Labels. 
For example, Labels could be the Name, the Date, the Recipient, or any other field of interest in the Document.

Within Konfuzio, Documents are assigned a Category, which in turn can be associated to one or more Label Set(s) and 
therefore to a Label. To be precise, it is Label Set(s) that are associated to Categories, and not the other way around.

Konfuzio offers several tools to run Information Extraction:

- [RFExtractionAI](https://dev.konfuzio.com/sdk/sourcecode.html#random-forest-extraction-ai) that utilizes a predefined architecture and can be trained on user's data;

- [Custom Extraction AI](https://dev.konfuzio.com/sdk/tutorials/information_extraction/index.html#train-a-custom-date-extraction-ai) that can use an architecture defined by the user or a pre-existing model;

Information Extraction always happens at a Category level, that is, operates under a single Category.
